Over the last three decades, the Berlin scene has fractured and fragmented into countless sounds, subgenres and micro-scenes, from the reggae-inspired dub techno underworld through to the concrete funk of Klockworks, the freewheeling trippiness of Ricardo Villalobos and the gritty industrial edge of Ostgut Ton. The history of Berlin after the fall of the wall allowed for underground warehouse raves across the city, developing a culture following the music. To this day it remains a hub and center for Techno.",

It is characterized by a stripped-down aesthetic that exploits the use of repetition and understated development. Minimal techno is thought to have been originally developed in the early 1990s by Detroit-based producers Robert Hood and Daniel Bell. By the early 2000s the term 'minimal' generally described a style of techno that was popularized in Germany by labels such as Kompakt, Perlon, and Richie Hawtin's M-nus, among others.",

The style is defined primarily by the squelching sounds and basslines of the Roland TB-303 electronic bass synthesizer-sequencer, an innovation attributed to Chicago producers DJ Pierre of Phuture and Sleezy D. Acid house soon became popular in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes. By the late 1980s, acid house had moved into the British mainstream, where it had some influence on pop and dance styles.",

It's also said that the deep moniker was given to the genre because of its soulful sound, which often features complex chord progressions and emotive melodies. Its origins are attributed to the early recordings of Larry Heard (aka Mr. Fingers), including his influential track 'Can You Feel It'.",
