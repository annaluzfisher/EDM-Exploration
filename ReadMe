This project was born from a desire to create something I have been tirelessly looking for - a good explanation of EDM and it's subgenres WITH an auditory component. 

The page is expected to allow the user to :
-- navigate through the edm sub-genres tree via bubbles on the page
-- see the path taken to the subgenre on the right of the page
-- play music of each sub-genre
-- mute music if need be
-- play with the visual BPM tool

additional features to be added include:
-- a search bar for key words in descriptions
-- a constant tree representation of the data below the main visualizer
-- styles of edm/fashion slideshow 


This project was made with vanilla javascript, native HTML audio, css, and lots and lots of love.
